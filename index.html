                <p> People talk about physical fitness, but mental health is equally not so important.We see
                    people sufering, and their families fuel a sense of shame about it, which doesn't help.</p>
                <p> One needs support and understanding and that's why we are here to listen to your thought as
                    you share what's bothering your mind with us.We know depresson begins with disappointment,
                    when disappointment fosters in our soul, it leads to discouragement</p>

                <p> Being sad and being depressed are two different things. Also, peolpe going through depressing
                    situations
                    don't look so,while someone sad will definitely look sad.The most common reaction is "How can you be
                    depressed?"
                    you have everything going for you.You are the supposed number one heroine, that's what almost
                    everyone
                    thinks.</p>

                <p> People who have never dealth with depresson think its just being sad or being in a bad mood.
                    That's not what depression is,its falling into a state of greyness and numbness.</p>

                <p> There isn't anybody out there who doesn't have a mental health issue,whether it is depression,
                    anxiety,
                    or how to cope with relationships. Having obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
                    is not an embarrasement anymore.Just know that there is help and your life could be better if you
                    seek
                    for our help. And the goodnews is
                    that, we are here for you to share your worries.</p>

                    <p> Sometimes coming to the decision to seek help can be difficult.You migth not feel comfortable
